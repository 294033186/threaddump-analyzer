# Java thread dump analyzer

This is a Java thread dump analyzer written in Javascript.

The idea is that this web page should live somewhere on the Internet
and help people all over analyze their thread dumps.

Web page here:  
https://ghe.spotify.net/pages/walles/threaddump-analyzer/

## TODO
* Connect the submit button to a Javascript function that simply
copies the whole thread dump to below the line.

* Parse the thread dump and reconstruct it below the line.

* Instead of recreating the thread dump, show it in a tree with
expandable nodes.

## DONE
* Publish the web page using Github pages.
