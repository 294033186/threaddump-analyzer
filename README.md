# Java thread dump analyzer

This is a Java thread dump analyzer written in Javascript.

The idea is that this web page should live somewhere on the Internet
and help people all over analyze their thread dumps.

# TODO
* Connect the submit button to a Javascript function that simply
copies the whole thread dump to below the line.

* Parse the thread dump and reconstruct it below the line.

* Instead of recreating the thread dump, show it in a tree with
expandable nodes.

# DONE
